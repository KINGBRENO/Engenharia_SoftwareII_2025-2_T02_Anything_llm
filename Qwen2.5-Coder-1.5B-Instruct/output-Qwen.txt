Based on the provided codebase, I can identify several architectural patterns that are present. Here are five predictions along with their associated probability percentages:

### 1. **Layered Architecture**
- **Justification:** The project is divided into multiple layers, each responsible for different functionalities. For example, the `server`, `collector`, and `frontend` folders contain distinct modules and services.
- **Probability Percentage:** 50%

### 2. **Client-Server Architecture**
- **Justification:** The application uses a client-server architecture where the client interacts with the server through APIs. This pattern is evident in the `server` and `collector` folders, where there are separate entry points (`index.js`) and configuration files (`nodemon.json`).
- **Probability Percentage:** 50%

### 3. **Microservices Architecture**
- **Justification:** The project consists of multiple microservices, each handling specific functionalities. For instance, the `server`, `collector`, and `frontend` folders contain separate services and configurations.
- **Probability Percentage:** 50%

### 4. **Monolithic Architecture**
- **Justification:** While the project is modularized, it does not exhibit the characteristics of a monolithic architecture. There are clear separation of concerns between different parts of the application.
- **Probability Percentage:** 25%

### 5. **Event-Driven Architecture**
- **Justification:** The project uses an event-driven architecture where events trigger actions. For example, the `server` and `collector` folders contain event handlers and listeners.
- **Probability Percentage:** 25%

These predictions are based on the presence of clear separation of concerns, modular design, and the use of different architectural patterns throughout the codebase.
