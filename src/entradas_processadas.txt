Run AnythingLLM in production without Docker
[!WARNING]
This method of deployment is **not supported** by the core-team and is to be used as a reference for your deployment.
You are fully responsible for securing your deployment and data in this mode.
**Any issues** experienced from bare-metal or non-containerized deployments will be **not** answered or supported.
Here you can find the scripts and known working process to run AnythingLLM outside of a Docker container.
Minimum Requirements
[!TIP]
You should aim for at least 2GB of RAM. Disk storage is proportional to however much data
you will be storing (documents, vectors, models, etc). Minimum 10GB recommended.
NodeJS v18
Yarn
Getting started
1. Clone the repo into your server as the user who the application will run as.
`git clone git@github.com:Mintplex-Labs/anything-llm.git`
2. `cd anything-llm` and run `yarn setup`. This will install all dependencies to run in production as well as debug the application.
3. `cp server/.env.example server/.env` to create the basic ENV file for where instance settings will be read from on service start.
4. Ensure that the `server/.env` file has _at least_ these keys to start. These values will persist and this file will be automatically written and managed after your first successful boot.
5. Edit the `frontend/.env` file for the `VITE_BASE_API` to now be set to `/api`. This is documented in the .env for which one you should use.
To start the application
AnythingLLM is comprised of three main sections. The `frontend`, `server`, and `collector`. When running in production you will be running `server` and `collector` on two different processes, with a build step for compilation of the frontend.
1. Build the frontend application.
`cd frontend && yarn build` - this will produce a `frontend/dist` folder that will be used later.
2. Copy `frontend/dist` to `server/public` - `cp -R frontend/dist server/public`.
This should create a folder in `server` named `public` which contains a top level `index.html` file and various other files/folders.
3. Migrate and prepare your database file.
4. Boot the server in production
`cd server && NODE_ENV=production node index.js &`
5. Boot the collection in another process
`cd collector && NODE_ENV=production node index.js &`
AnythingLLM should now be running on `
Updating AnythingLLM
To update AnythingLLM with future updates you can `git pull origin master` to pull in the latest code and then repeat steps 2 - 5 to deploy with all changes fully.
_note_ You should ensure that each folder runs `yarn` again to ensure packages are up to date in case any dependencies were added, changed, or removed.
_note_ You should `pkill node` before running an update so that you are not running multiple AnythingLLM processes on the same instance as this can cause conflicts.
Example update script
Using Nginx?
If you are using Nginx, you can use the following example configuration to proxy the requests to the server. Chats for streaming require **websocket** connections, so you need to ensure that the Nginx configuration is set up to support websockets. You can do this with a simple reverse proxy configuration.

Contributing to AnythingLLM
AnythingLLM is an open-source project and we welcome contributions from the community.
Reporting Issues
If you encounter a bug or have a feature request, please open an issue on the
GitHub issue tracker.
Picking an issue
We track issues on the GitHub issue tracker. If you are looking for something to
work on, check the good first issue label. These issues are typically the best described and have the smallest scope. There may be issues that are not labeled as good first issue, but are still a good starting point.
If there's an issue you are interested in working on, please leave a comment on the issue. This will help us avoid duplicate work. Additionally, if you have questions about the issue, please ask them in the issue comments. We are happy to provide guidance on how to approach the issue.
Before you start
Keep in mind that we are a small team and have limited resources. We will do our best to review and merge your PRs, but please be patient. Ultimately, **we become the maintainer** of your changes. It is our responsibility to make sure that the changes are working as expected and are of high quality as well as being compatible with the rest of the project both for existing users and for future users & features.
Before you start working on an issue, please read the following so that you don't waste time on something that is not a good fit for the project or is more suitable for a personal fork. We would rather answer a comment on an issue than close a PR after you've spent time on it. Your time is valuable and we appreciate your time and effort to make AnythingLLM better.
0. (most important) If you are making a PR that does not have a corresponding issue, **it will not be merged.** _The only exception to this is language translations._
1. If you are modifying the permission system for a new role or something custom, you are likely better off forking the project and building your own version since this is a core part of the project and is only to be maintained by the AnythingLLM team.
2. Integrations (LLM, Vector DB, etc.) are reviewed at our discretion. We will eventually get to them. Do not expect us to merge your integration PR instantly since there are often many moving parts and we want to make sure we get it right. We will get to it!
3. It is our discretion to merge or not merge a PR. We value every contribution, but we also value the quality of the code and the user experience we envision for the project. It is a fine line to walk when running a project like this and please understand that merging or not merging a PR is not a reflection of the quality of the contribution and is not personal. We will do our best to provide feedback on the PR and help you make the changes necessary to get it merged.
4. **Security** is always important. If you have a security concern, please do not open an issue. Instead, please open a CVE on our designated reporting platform Huntr or contact us at team@mintplexlabs.com.
Configuring Git
First, fork the repository on GitHub, then clone your fork:
Then add the main repository as a remote:
Setting up your development environment
In the root of the repository, run:
This will install the dependencies, set up the proper and expected ENV files for the project, and run the prisma setup script.
Next, run:
This will start the server, frontend, and collector in development mode. Changes to the code will be hot reloaded.
Best practices for pull requests
For the best chance of having your pull request accepted, please follow these guidelines:
1. Unit test all bug fixes and new features. Your code will not be merged if it
 doesn't have tests.
1. If you change the public API, update the documentation in the `anythingllm-docs` repository.
1. Aim to minimize the number of changes in each pull request. Keep to solving
 one problem at a time, when possible.
1. Before marking a pull request ready-for-review, do a self review of your code.
 Is it clear why you are making the changes? Are the changes easy to understand?
1. Use conventional commit messages as pull request titles. Examples:
 * New feature: `feat: adding foo API`
 * Bug fix: `fix: issue with foo API`
 * Documentation change: `docs: adding foo API documentation`
1. If your pull request is a work in progress, leave the pull request as a draft.
 We will assume the pull request is ready for review when it is opened.
1. When writing tests, test the error cases. Make sure they have understandable
 error messages.
Project structure
The core library is written in Node.js. There are additional sub-repositories for the embed widget and browser extension. These are not part of the core AnythingLLM project, but are maintained by the AnythingLLM team.
`server`: Node.js server source code
`frontend`: React frontend source code
`collector`: Python collector source code
Release process
Changes to the core AnythingLLM project are released through the `master` branch. When a PR is merged into `master`, a new version of the package is published to Docker and GitHub Container Registry under the `latest` tag.
When a new version is released, the following steps are taken a new image is built and pushed to Docker Hub and GitHub Container Registry under the assoicated version tag. Version tags are of the format `v<major>.<minor>.<patch>` and are pinned code, while `latest` is the latest version of the code at any point in time.
Desktop propogation
Changes to the desktop app are downstream of the core AnythingLLM project. Releases of the desktop app are published at the same time as the core AnythingLLM project. Code from the core AnythingLLM project is copied into the desktop app into an Electron wrapper. The Electron wrapper that wraps around the core AnythingLLM project is **not** part of the core AnythingLLM project, but is maintained by the AnythingLLM team.

Product Overview
AnythingLLM is a full-stack application where you can use commercial off-the-shelf LLMs or popular open source LLMs and vectorDB solutions to build a private ChatGPT with no compromises that you can run locally as well as host remotely and be able to chat intelligently with any documents you provide it.
AnythingLLM divides your documents into objects called `workspaces`. A Workspace functions a lot like a thread, but with the addition of containerization of your documents. Workspaces can share documents, but they do not talk to each other so you can keep your context for each workspace clean.

How to setup for development
`yarn setup` To fill in the required `.env` files you'll need in each of the application sections (from root of repo).
 - Go fill those out before proceeding. Ensure `server/.env.development` is filled or else things won't work right.
`yarn dev:server` To boot the server locally (from root of repo).
`yarn dev:frontend` To boot the frontend locally (from root of repo).
`yarn dev:collector` To then run the document collector (from root of repo).

Telemetry & Privacy
AnythingLLM by Mintplex Labs Inc contains a telemetry feature that collects anonymous usage information.
<details>
<summary><kbd>More about Telemetry & Privacy for AnythingLLM</kbd></summary>
Why?
We use this information to help us understand how AnythingLLM is used, to help us prioritize work on new features and bug fixes, and to help us improve AnythingLLM's performance and stability.
Opting out
Set `DISABLE_TELEMETRY` in your server or docker .env settings to "true" to opt out of telemetry. You can also do this in-app by going to the sidebar > `Privacy` and disabling telemetry.
What do you explicitly track?
We will only track usage details that help us make product and roadmap decisions, specifically:
Type of your installation (Docker or Desktop)
When a document is added or removed. No information _about_ the document. Just that the event occurred. This gives us an idea of use.
Type of vector database in use. This helps us prioritize changes when updates arrive for that provider.
Type of LLM provider & model tag in use. This helps us prioritize changes when updates arrive for that provider or model, or combination thereof. eg: reasoning vs regular, multi-modal models, etc.
When a chat is sent. This is the most regular "event" and gives us an idea of the daily-activity of this project across all installations. Again, only the **event** is sent - we have no information on the nature or content of the chat itself.
You can verify these claims by finding all locations `Telemetry.sendTelemetry` is called. Additionally these events are written to the output log so you can also see the specific data which was sent - if enabled. **No IP or other identifying information is collected**. The Telemetry provider is PostHog - an open-source telemetry collection service.
We take privacy very seriously, and we hope you understand that we want to learn how our tool is used, without using annoying popup surveys, so we can build something worth using. The anonymous data is _never_ shared with third parties, ever.

AnythingLLM Development Container Setup
Welcome to the AnythingLLM development container configuration, designed to create a seamless and feature-rich development environment for this project.
<center><h1><b>PLEASE READ THIS</b></h1></center>
Prerequisites
Docker
Visual Studio Code
Remote - Containers VS Code extension
Features
**Base Image**: Built on `mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/javascript-node:1-18-bookworm`, thus Node.JS LTS v18.
**Additional Tools**: Includes `hadolint`, and essential apt-packages such as `curl`, `gnupg`, and more.
**Ports**: Configured to auto-forward ports `3000` (Frontend) and `3001` (Backend).
**Environment Variables**: Sets `NODE_ENV` to `development` and `ESLINT_USE_FLAT_CONFIG` to `true`.
**VS Code Extensions**: A suite of extensions such as `Prettier`, `Docker`, `ESLint`, and more are automatically installed. Please revise if you do not agree with any of these extensions. AI-powered extensions and time trackers are (for now) not included to avoid any privacy concerns, but you can install them later in your own environment.
Getting Started
1. Using GitHub Codespaces. Just select to create a new workspace, and the devcontainer will be created for you.
2. Using your Local VSCode (Release or Insiders). We suggest you first make a fork of the repo and then clone it to your local machine using VSCode tools. Then open the project folder in VSCode, which will prompt you to open the project in a devcontainer. Select yes, and the devcontainer will be created for you. If this does not happen, you can open the command palette and select "Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container".
On Creation:
When the container is built for the first time, it will automatically run `yarn setup` to ensure everything is in place for the Collector, Server and Frontend. This command is expected to be automatically re-run if there is a content change on next reboot.
Work in the Container:
Once the container is up, be patient. Some extensions may complain because dependencies are still being installed, and in the Extensions tab, some may ask you to "Reload" the project. Don't do that yet. First, wait until all settle down for the first time. We suggest you create a new VSCode profile for this devcontainer, so any configuration and extensions you change, won't affect your default profile.
Checklist:
[ ] The usual message asking you to start the Server and Frontend in different windows are now "hidden" in the building process of the devcontainer. Don't forget to do as suggested.
[ ] Open a JavaScript file, for example "server/index.js" and check if `eslint` is working. It will complain that `'err' is defined but never used.`. This means it is working.
[ ] Open a React File, for example, "frontend/src/main.jsx," and check if `eslint` complains about `Fast refresh only works when a file has exports. Move your component(s) to a separate file.`. Again, it means `eslint` is working. Now check at the status bar if the `Prettier` has a double checkmark :heavy_check_mark: (double). It means Prettier is working. You will see a nice extension `Formatting:`:heavy_check_mark: that can be used to disable the `Format on Save` feature temporarily.
[ ] Check if, on the left pane, you have the NPM Scripts (this may be disabled; look at the "Explorer" tree-dots up-right). There will be scripts inside the `package.json` files. You will basically need to run the `dev:collector`, `dev:server` and the `dev:frontend` in this order. When the frontend finishes starting, a window browser will open **inside** the VSCode. Still, you can open it outside.
:warning: **Important for all developers** :warning:
[ ] When you are using the `NODE_ENV=development` the server will not store the configurations you set for security reasons. Please set the proper config on file `.env.development`. The side-effect if you don't, everytime you restart the server, you will be sent to the "Onboarding" page again.
Note when using GitHub Codespaces**
[ ] When running the "Server" for the first time, it will automatically configure its port to be publicly accessible by default, as this is required for the front end to reach the server backend. To know more, read the content of the `.env` file on the frontend folder about this, and if any issues occur, make sure to manually set the port "Visibility" of the "Server" is set to "Public" if needed. Again, this is only needed for developing on GitHub Codespaces.
For the Collector:**
[x] In the past, the Collector dwelled within the Python domain, but now it has journeyed to the splendid realm of Node.JS. Consequently, the configuration complexities of bygone versions are no longer a concern.
Now it is ready to start
In the status bar you will see three shortcuts names `Collector`, `Server` and `Frontend`. Just click-and-wait on that order (don't forget to set the Server port 3001 to Public if you are using GH Codespaces **_before_** starting the Frontend).
Now you can enjoy your time developing instead of reconfiguring everything.
Debugging with the devcontainers
For debugging the collector, server and frontend
First, make sure the built-in extension (ms-vscode.js-debug) is active (I don't know why it would not be, but just in case). If you want, you can install the nightly version (ms-vscode.js-debug-nightly)
Then, in the "Run and Debug" tab (Ctrl+shift+D), you can select on the menu:
Collector debug. This will start the collector in debug mode and attach the debugger. Works very well.
Server debug. This will start the server in debug mode and attach the debugger. Works very well.
Frontend debug. This will start the frontend in debug mode and attach the debugger. I am still struggling with this one. I don't know if VSCode can handle the .jsx files seamlessly as the pure .js on the server. Maybe there is a need for a particular configuration for Vite or React. Anyway, it starts. Another two configurations launch Chrome and Edge, and I think we could add breakpoints on .jsx files somehow. The best scenario would be always to use the embedded browser. WIP.

How to deploy a private AnythingLLM instance on AWS
With an AWS account you can easily deploy a private AnythingLLM instance on AWS. This will create a url that you can access from any browser over HTTP (HTTPS not supported). This single instance will run on your own keys and they will not be exposed - however if you want your instance to be protected it is highly recommend that you set a password once setup is complete.
Quick Launch (EASY)**
1. Log in to your AWS account
2. Open CloudFormation
3. Ensure you are deploying in a geographic zone that is nearest to your physical location to reduce latency.
4. Click `Create Stack`
5. Use the file `cloudformation_create_anythingllm.json` as your JSON template.
6. Click Deploy. 
7. Wait for stack events to finish and be marked as `Completed`
8. View `Outputs` tab.
9. Wait for all resources to be built. Now wait until instance is available on `[InstanceIP]:3001`.
This process may take up to 10 minutes. See **Note** below on how to visualize this process.
The output of this cloudformation stack will be:
1 EC2 Instance
1 Security Group with 0.0.0.0/0 access on port 3001
1 EC2 Instance Volume `gb2` of 10Gib minimum - customizable pre-deploy.
Requirements**
An AWS account with billing information.
Please read this notice before submitting issues about your deployment
Note:** 
Your instance will not be available instantly. Depending on the instance size you launched with it can take 5-10 minutes to fully boot up.
If you want to check the instance's progress, navigate to your deployed EC2 instances and connect to your instance via SSH in browser.
Once connected run `sudo tail -f /var/log/cloud-init-output.log` and wait for the file to conclude deployment of the docker image.
You should see an output like this
Additionally, your use of this deployment process means you are responsible for any costs of these AWS resources fully.

anythingllm
AnythingLLM
The all-in-one Desktop & Docker AI application with built-in RAG, AI agents, No-code agent builder, MCP compatibility, and more.
Configuration & Usage**
**Config vs Secrets:** This chart exposes application configuration via two mechanisms:
 - `config` (in `values.yaml`) — rendered into a `ConfigMap` and injected using `envFrom` in the pod. Do NOT place sensitive values (API keys, secrets) in `config` because `ConfigMap`s are not encrypted.
 - `env` / `envFrom` — the preferred way to inject secrets. Use Kubernetes `Secret` objects and reference them from `env` (with `valueFrom.secretKeyRef`) or `envFrom.secretRef`.
**Storage & STORAGE_DIR mapping:** The chart creates (or mounts) a `PersistentVolumeClaim` using the `persistentVolume.*` settings. The container mount path is set from `persistentVolume.mountPath`. Ensure the container `STORAGE_DIR` config key matches that path (defaults are set in `values.yaml`).
Providing API keys & secrets (recommended)**
Use Kubernetes Secrets. Below are example workflows and `values.yaml` snippets.
1) Create a Kubernetes Secret with API keys:
2) Reference the Secret from `values.yaml` using `envFrom` (recommended when your secret contains multiple env keys):
This will inject all key/value pairs from the `openai-secret` Secret as environment variables in the container.
3) Or reference a single secret key via `env` (explicit mapping):
Notes:
Avoid placing secret values into `config:` (the chart's `ConfigMap`) — `ConfigMap`s are visible to anyone who can read the namespace. Use `Secret` objects for any credentials/tokens.
If you use a GitOps workflow, consider integrating an external secret operator (ExternalSecrets, SealedSecrets, etc.) so you don't store raw secrets in Git.
Example `values-secret.yaml` to pass during `helm install`**
Install with:
Best practices & tips**
Use `envFrom` for convenience when many environment variables are stored in a single `Secret` and use `env`/`valueFrom` for explicit single-key mappings.
Use `kubectl create secret generic` or your secrets management solution. If you need to reference multiple different provider keys (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.), create a single `Secret` with multiple keys or multiple Secrets and add multiple `envFrom` entries.
Keep probe paths and `service.port` aligned. If your probes fail after deployment, check that the probe `port` matches the container port (or named port ` and that the `path` is valid.
For storage, if you have a pre-existing PVC set `persistentVolume.existingClaim` to the PVC name; the chart will mount that claim (and will not attempt to create a new PVC).
For production, provide resource `requests` and `limits` in `values.yaml` to prevent scheduler starvation and to control cost.

How to use Dockerized Anything LLM
Use the Dockerized version of AnythingLLM for a much faster and complete startup of AnythingLLM.
Minimum Requirements
[!TIP]
Running AnythingLLM on AWS/GCP/Azure?
You should aim for at least 2GB of RAM. Disk storage is proportional to however much data
you will be storing (documents, vectors, models, etc). Minimum 10GB recommended.
`docker` installed on your machine
`yarn` and `node` on your machine
access to an LLM running locally or remotely
\*AnythingLLM by default uses a built-in vector database powered by LanceDB
\*AnythingLLM by default embeds text on instance privately Learn More
Recommend way to run dockerized AnythingLLM!
[!IMPORTANT]
If you are running another service on localhost like Chroma, LocalAi, or LMStudio
you will need to use to access the service from within
the docker container using AnythingLLM as `localhost:xxxx` will not resolve for the host system.
> **Requires** Docker v18.03+ on Win/Mac and 20.10+ on Linux/Ubuntu for host.docker.internal to resolve!
> _Linux_: add `--add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway` to docker run command for this to resolve.
> eg: Chroma host URL running on localhost:8000 on host machine needs to be 
when used in AnythingLLM.
[!TIP]
It is best to mount the containers storage volume to a folder on your host machine
so that you can pull in future updates without deleting your existing data!
Pull in the latest image from docker. Supports both `amd64` and `arm64` CPU architectures.

Go to ` and you are now using AnythingLLM! All your data and progress will persist between
container rebuilds or pulls from Docker Hub.
How to use the user interface
To access the full application, visit ` in your browser.
About UID and GID in the ENV
The UID and GID are set to 1000 by default. This is the default user in the Docker container and on most host operating systems. If there is a mismatch between your host user UID and GID and what is set in the `.env` file, you may experience permission issues.
Build locally from source _not recommended for casual use_
`git clone` this repo and `cd anything-llm` to get to the root directory.
`touch server/storage/anythingllm.db` to create empty SQLite DB file.
`cd docker/`
`cp .env.example .env` **you must do this before building**
`docker-compose up -d --build` to build the image - this will take a few moments.
Your docker host will show the image as online once the build process is completed. This will build the app to `
Integrations and one-click setups
The integrations below are templates or tooling built by the community to make running the docker experience of AnythingLLM easier.
Use the Midori AI Subsystem to Manage AnythingLLM
Follow the setup found on Midori AI Subsystem Site for your host OS
After setting that up install the AnythingLLM docker backend to the Midori AI Subsystem.
Once that is done, you are all set!
Common questions and fixes
Cannot connect to service running on localhost!
If you are in docker and cannot connect to a service running on your host machine running on a local interface or loopback:
`localhost`
`127.0.0.1`
`0.0.0.0`
[!IMPORTANT]
On linux ` does not work.
Use ` instead to emulate this functionality.
Then in docker you need to replace that localhost part with `host.docker.internal`. For example, if running Ollama on the host machine, bound to you should put ` into the connection URL in AnythingLLM.
API is not working, cannot login, LLM is "offline"?
You are likely running the docker container on a remote machine like EC2 or some other instance where the reachable URL
is not ` and instead is something like ` - in this case all you need to do is add the following to your `frontend/.env.production` before running `docker-compose up -d --build`
For example, if the docker instance is available on `192.186.1.222` your `VITE_API_BASE` would look like `VITE_API_BASE=" in `frontend/.env.production`.
Having issues with Ollama?
If you are getting errors like `llama:streaming - could not stream chat. Error: connect ECONNREFUSED 172.17.0.1:11434` then visit the README below.

製品概要
AnythingLLMは、市販のLLMや人気のあるオープンソースLLM、およびベクトルDBソリューションを使用して、妥協のないプライベートChatGPTを構築できるフルスタックアプリケーションです。ローカルで実行することも、リモートでホストすることもでき、提供されたドキュメントと知的にチャットできます。
AnythingLLMは、ドキュメントを`ワークスペース`と呼ばれるオブジェクトに分割します。ワークスペースはスレッドのように機能しますが、ドキュメントのコンテナ化が追加されています。ワークスペースはドキュメントを共有できますが、互いに通信することはないため、各ワークスペースのコンテキストをクリーンに保つことができます。
AnythingLLMのいくつかのクールな機能
**マルチユーザーインスタンスのサポートと権限付与**
ワークスペース内のエージェント(ウェブを閲覧、コードを実行など)
ウェブサイト用のカスタム埋め込み可能なチャットウィジェット
複数のドキュメントタイプのサポート(PDF、TXT、DOCXなど)
シンプルなUIからベクトルデータベース内のドキュメントを管理
2つのチャットモード`会話`と`クエリ`。会話は以前の質問と修正を保持します。クエリはドキュメントに対するシンプルなQAです
チャット中の引用
100%クラウドデプロイメント対応。
「独自のLLMを持参」モデル。
大規模なドキュメントを管理するための非常に効率的なコスト削減策。巨大なドキュメントやトランスクリプトを埋め込むために一度以上支払うことはありません。他のドキュメントチャットボットソリューションよりも90%コスト効率が良いです。

Telemetri ve Gizlilik 
Mintplex Labs Inc. tarafından geliştirilen AnythingLLM, anonim kullanım bilgilerini toplayan bir telemetri özelliği içermektedir. 
<details> 
<summary><kbd>AnythingLLM için Telemetri ve Gizlilik hakkında daha fazla bilgi</kbd></summary> 
Neden? 
Bu bilgileri, AnythingLLM’in nasıl kullanıldığını anlamak, yeni özellikler ve hata düzeltmelerine öncelik vermek ve uygulamanın performansını ve kararlılığını iyileştirmek için kullanıyoruz. 
Telemetriden Çıkış Yapma (Opt-Out) 
Sunucu veya Docker `.env` ayarlarında `DISABLE_TELEMETRY` değerini "true" olarak ayarlayarak telemetriyi devre dışı bırakabilirsiniz. Ayrıca, uygulama içinde **Kenar Çubuğu > Gizlilik** bölümüne giderek de bu özelliği kapatabilirsiniz. 
Hangi Verileri Açıkça Takip Ediyoruz? 
Yalnızca ürün ve yol haritası kararlarını almamıza yardımcı olacak kullanım detaylarını takip ediyoruz: 
Kurulum türü (Docker veya Masaüstü) 
Bir belgenin eklenme veya kaldırılma olayı. **Belgenin içeriği hakkında hiçbir bilgi toplanmaz**, yalnızca olayın gerçekleştiği kaydedilir. Bu, kullanım sıklığını anlamamıza yardımcı olur. 
Kullanılan vektör veritabanı türü. Hangi sağlayıcının daha çok tercih edildiğini belirlemek için bu bilgiyi topluyoruz. 
Kullanılan LLM türü. En popüler modelleri belirleyerek bu sağlayıcılara öncelik verebilmemizi sağlar. 
Sohbet başlatılması. Bu en sık gerçekleşen "olay" olup, projenin günlük etkinliği hakkında genel bir fikir edinmemize yardımcı olur. **Yalnızca olay kaydedilir, sohbetin içeriği veya doğası hakkında hiçbir bilgi toplanmaz.** 
Bu verileri doğrulamak için kod içinde **`Telemetry.sendTelemetry` çağrılarını** inceleyebilirsiniz. Ayrıca, bu olaylar günlük kaydına yazıldığı için hangi verilerin gönderildiğini görebilirsiniz (eğer etkinleştirilmişse). **IP adresi veya diğer tanımlayıcı bilgiler toplanmaz.** Telemetri sağlayıcısı, açık kaynaklı bir telemetri toplama hizmeti olan PostHog‘dur.

===== C:\Users\Breno\AppData\Local\Temp\repo_1u3zfsju\repo\server\storage\README.md =====
AnythingLLM Storage
This folder is for the local or disk storage of ready-to-embed documents, vector-cached embeddings, and the disk-storage of LanceDB and the local SQLite database.
This folder should contain the following folders.
`documents`
`lancedb` (if using lancedb)
`vector-cache`
and a file named exactly `anythingllm.db`
Common issues
SQLITE_FILE_CANNOT_BE_OPENED** in the server log = The DB file does not exist probably because the node instance does not have the correct permissions to write a file to the disk. To solve this..
Local dev
 - Create a `anythingllm.db` empty file in this directory. Thats all. No need to reboot the server or anything. If your permissions are correct this should not ever occur since the server will create the file if it does not exist automatically.
Docker Instance
 - Get your AnythingLLM docker container id with `docker ps -a`. The container must be running to execute the next commands.
 - Run `docker container exec -u 0 -t <ANYTHINGLLM DOCKER CONTAINER ID> mkdir -p /app/server/storage /app/server/storage/documents /app/server/storage/vector-cache /app/server/storage/lancedb`
 - Run `docker container exec -u 0 -t <ANYTHINGLLM DOCKER CONTAINER ID> touch /app/server/storage/anythingllm.db`
 - Run `docker container exec -u 0 -t <ANYTHINGLLM DOCKER CONTAINER ID> chown -R anythingllm:anythingllm /app/collector /app/server`
 - The above commands will create the appropriate folders inside of the docker container and will persist as long as you do not destroy the container and volume. This will also fix any ownership issues of folder files in the collector and the server.


===== C:\Users\Breno\AppData\Local\Temp\repo_1u3zfsju\repo\server\storage\documents\DOCUMENTS.md =====
What is this folder of documents?
This is a temporary cache of the resulting files you have collected from `collector/`. You really should not be adding files manually to this folder. However the general format of this is you should partion data by how it was collected - it will be added to the appropriate namespace when you undergo vectorizing.
You can manage these files from the frontend application.
All files should be JSON files and in general there is only one main required key: `pageContent` all other keys will be inserted as metadata for each document inserted into the vector DB.
There is also a special reserved key called `published` that should be reserved for timestamps.


===== C:\Users\Breno\AppData\Local\Temp\repo_1u3zfsju\repo\server\storage\models\README.md =====
Native models used by AnythingLLM
This folder is specifically created as a local cache and storage folder that is used for native models that can run on a CPU.
Currently, AnythingLLM uses this folder for the following parts of the application.
Embedding
When your embedding engine preference is `native` we will use the ONNX **all-MiniLM-L6-v2** model built by Xenova on HuggingFace.co. This model is a quantized and WASM version of the popular all-MiniLM-L6-v2 which produces a 384-dimension vector.
If you are using the `native` embedding engine your vector database should be configured to accept 384-dimension models if that parameter is directly editable (Pinecone only).
Audio/Video transcription
AnythingLLM allows you to upload various audio and video formats as source documents. In all cases the audio tracks will be transcribed by a locally running ONNX model **whisper-small** built by Xenova on HuggingFace.co. The model is a smaller version of the OpenAI Whisper model. Given the model runs locally on CPU, larger files will result in longer transcription times.
Once transcribed you can embed these transcriptions into your workspace like you would any other file! 
Other external model/transcription providers are also live.**
OpenAI Whisper via API key.
Text generation (LLM selection)
[!IMPORTANT]
Use of a locally running LLM model is **experimental** and may behave unexpectedly, crash, or not function at all.
We suggest for production-use of a local LLM model to use a purpose-built inference server like LocalAI or LMStudio.
[!TIP]
We recommend at _least_ using a 4-bit or 5-bit quantized model for your LLM. Lower quantization models tend to
just output unreadable garbage.
If you would like to use a local Llama compatible LLM model for chatting you can select any model from this HuggingFace search filter
Requirements**
Model must be in the latest `GGUF` format
Model should be compatible with latest `llama.cpp`
You should have the proper RAM to run such a model. Requirement depends on model size.
Where do I put my GGUF model?
[!IMPORTANT]
If running in Docker you should be running the container to a mounted storage location on the host machine so you
can update the storage files directly without having to re-download or re-build your docker container. See suggested Docker config
[!NOTE]
`/server/storage/models/downloaded` is the default location that your model files should be at. 
Your storage directory may differ if you changed the STORAGE_DIR environment variable.
All local models you want to have available for LLM selection should be placed in the `server/storage/models/downloaded` folder. Only `.gguf` files will be allowed to be selected from the UI.


===== C:\Users\Breno\AppData\Local\Temp\repo_1u3zfsju\repo\server\utils\AiProviders\ollama\README.md =====
Common Issues with Ollama
If you encounter an error stating `llama:streaming - could not stream chat. Error: connect ECONNREFUSED 172.17.0.1:11434` when using AnythingLLM in a Docker container, this indicates that the IP of the Host inside of the virtual docker network does not bind to port 11434 of the host system by default, due to Ollama's restriction to localhost and 127.0.0.1. To resolve this issue and ensure proper communication between the Dockerized AnythingLLM and the Ollama service, you must configure Ollama to bind to 0.0.0.0 or a specific IP address.
Setting Environment Variables on Mac
If Ollama is run as a macOS application, environment variables should be set using `launchctl`:
1. For each environment variable, call `launchctl setenv`.
2. Restart the Ollama application.
Setting Environment Variables on Linux
If Ollama is run as a systemd service, environment variables should be set using `systemctl`:
1. Edit the systemd service by calling `systemctl edit ollama.service`. This will open an editor.
2. For each environment variable, add a line `Environment` under the section `[Service]`:
3. Save and exit.
4. Reload `systemd` and restart Ollama:
Setting Environment Variables on Windows
On Windows, Ollama inherits your user and system environment variables.
1. First, quit Ollama by clicking on it in the taskbar.
2. Edit system environment variables from the Control Panel.
3. Edit or create new variable(s) for your user account for `OLLAMA_HOST`, `OLLAMA_MODELS`, etc.
4. Click OK/Apply to save.
5. Run `ollama` from a new terminal window.


===== C:\Users\Breno\AppData\Local\Temp\repo_1u3zfsju\repo\server\utils\prisma\PRISMA.md =====
Prisma Setup and Usage Guide
This guide will help you set up and use Prisma for the project. Prisma is a powerful ORM for Node.js and TypeScript, helping developers build faster and make fewer errors. Follow the guide to understand how to use Prisma and the scripts available in the project to manage the Prisma setup.
Setting Up Prisma
To get started with setting up Prisma, you should run the setup script from the project root directory:
This script will install the necessary node modules in both the server and frontend directories, set up the environment files, and set up Prisma (generate client, run migrations, and seed the database).
Prisma Scripts
In the project root's `package.json`, there are several scripts set up to help you manage Prisma:
**prisma:generate**: Generates the Prisma client.
**prisma:migrate**: Runs the migrations to ensure the database is in sync with the schema.
**prisma:seed**: Seeds the database with initial data.
**prisma:setup**: A convenience script that runs `prisma:generate`, `prisma:migrate`, and `prisma:seed` in sequence.
**sqlite:migrate**: (To be run from the `server` directory) This script is for users transitioning from the old SQLite custom ORM setup to Prisma and will migrate all existing data over to Prisma. If you're a new user, your setup will already use Prisma.
To run any of these scripts, use `yarn` followed by the script name from the project root directory. For example:
Manual Prisma Commands
While the scripts should cover most of your needs, you may sometimes want to run Prisma commands manually. Here are some commands you might find useful, along with their descriptions:
`npx prisma introspect`: Introspects the database to update the Prisma schema by reading the schema of the existing database.
`npx prisma generate`: Generates the Prisma client.
`npx prisma migrate dev --name init`: Ensures the database is in sync with the schema, naming the migration 'init'.
`npx prisma migrate reset`: Resets the database, deleting all data and recreating the schema.
These commands should be run from the `server` directory, where the Prisma schema is located.
Notes
Always make sure to run scripts from the root level to avoid path issues.
Before running migrations, ensure that the Prisma schema is correctly defined to prevent data loss or corruption.
If you are adding a new feature or making changes that require a change in the database schema, create a new migration rather than editing existing migrations.
For users transitioning from the old SQLite ORM, navigate to the `server` directory and run the `sqlite:migrate` script to smoothly transition to Prisma. If you're setting up the project fresh, this step is unnecessary as the setup will already be using Prisma.

===== C:\Users\Breno\AppData\Local\Temp\repo_1u3zfsju\repo\server\utils\vectorDbProviders\pgvector\SETUP.md =====
Setting up `PGVector` for AnythingLLM
Setting up PGVector for anythingllm to use as your vector database is quite easy. At a minimum, you will need the following:
PostgreSQL v12+
`pgvector` extension installed on DB
User with DB table creation perms and READ access
Setup on Mac (example)
Install pgvector extension on PostgreSQL DB
Set PG as your vector db
_this can be done via the UI or by directly editing the `.env` file_
First, obtain a valid connection string for the user, credentials, and db you want to target.
eg: `postgresql://dbuser:dbuserpass@localhost:5432/yourdb`
[!IMPORTANT]
If you have an existing table that you want to use as a vector database, AnythingLLM **requires** that the table be
at least minimally conform to the expected schema - this can be seen in the index.js file.
_optional_ - set a table name you wish to have AnythingLLM store vectors to. By default this is `anythingllm_vectors`
Common Questions
I cannot connect to the DB (Running AnythingLLM in Docker)
If you are running AnythingLLM in Docker, you will need to ensure that the DB is accessible from the container.
If you are running your DB in another Docker container **or** on the host machine, you will need to ensure that the container can access the DB.
`localhost` will not work in this case as it will attempt to connect to the DB _inside the AnythingLLM container_ instead of the host machine or another container.
You will need to use the `host.docker.internal` (or `172.17.0.1` on Linux/Ubuntu) address.
Can I use an existing table as a vector database?
Yes, you can use an existing table as a vector database. However, AnythingLLM **requires** that the table be at least minimally conform to the expected schema - this can be seen in the index.js file.
It is **absolutely critical** that the `embedding` column's `VECTOR(XXXX)` dimensions match the dimension of the embedder in AnythingLLM. The default embedding model is 384 dimensions. However, if you are using a custom embedder, you will need to ensure that the dimension value is set correctly.
Validate the connection to the database
When setting the connection string in or table name via the AnythingLLM UI, the following validations will be attempted:
Validate the connection string
Validate the table name
Run test connection to ensure the table exists and is accessible by the connection string used
Check if the table name already exists and if so, validate that it is an embedding table with the correct schema
My embedding table is not present in the DB
The embedding storage table is created by AnythingLLM **on the first upsert** of a vector. If you have not yet embedding any documents, the table will not be present in the DB.
How do I reset my vector database?
_at the workspace level in Settings > Vector Database_
You can use the "Reset Vector Database" button in the AnythingLLM UI to reset your vector database. This will drop all vectors within that workspace, but the table will remain in the DB.
_reset the vector database at the db level_
For this, you will need to `DROP TABLE` from the command line or however you manage your DB. Once the table is dropped, it will be recreated by AnythingLLM on the next upsert.
Troubleshooting
Cannot connect to DB
Ensure the connection string is valid
Ensure the user has access to the database
Ensure the pgvector extension is installed
Cannot create table
Ensure the user has `CREATE TABLE` permissions
Cannot insert vector
Ensure the user has `INSERT` permissions in the database
Ensure the table has a dimension value set and this matches the dimension of the embedder in AnythingLLM
Ensure the table has a vector column set
Cannot query vector
Ensure the user has `SELECT` permissions in the database
Ensure the table has a vector column set
Ensure the table has a dimension value set and this matches the dimension of the embedder in AnythingLLM
"type 'vector' does not exist" issues with PGVector
If you are using the PGVector as your vector database, you may encounter an error similar to the following when embedding documents:
This is due to the fact that the `vector` type is not installed on the PG database.
First, follow the instructions in the PGVector README to install the `vector` type on your database.
Then, you will need to create the extension on the database. This can be done by running the following command:
